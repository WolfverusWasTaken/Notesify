Notesify is a demo/early version (v0) of my upcoming project, DOLOS-web, which is(hopefully) an upgraded version of my previous project, [Project DOLOS](https://github.com/WolfverusWasTaken/Project-DOLOS). This project is designed to allow you to read PDFs and convert them to notes for your personal usage.

The overarching idea/plan is to build DOLOS-web over the finalized version of Notesify.

## Technologies Used

- Django
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (To change in the future)

## Features

- Basic UI to select PDFs to read
- Simple and clean design
- Lots of features planned.

## Changelog

- **071024**: Created base files and basic UI w/ file selection

## Future Plans

As development progresses, I plan to add more features and improvements. Stay tuned for updates!
